# Hi, I'm Guillermo Vidal 👋 
### AI Engineer | Data Engineer | Cloud Architect

I am an AI and Data Engineer specializing in Cloud-Native architectures (Azure/GCP) and Generative AI. My focus is on building high-impact RAG systems, MLOps pipelines, and scalable data platforms that transform complex information into operational efficiency.

---

## 🚀 Key Achievements & Impact
- **Optimized operational workflows by 95%** through Python, FastAPI, and Docker-based ETL/ELT pipelines.
- **Reduced HR processing time by 90%** (from 20 to 2 minutes) by implementing Generative AI (GPT-4) and Whisper for automated data extraction.
- **97% accuracy** achieved in fuel consumption predictive models using XGBoost and MLOps best practices.
